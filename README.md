# Digital Resource Glossary Feature Documentation

## Overview

The Digital Resource Glossary feature is an interactive tool available on the [Library's Digital Resources page](https://library.austintexas.gov/digital/all). It enhances navigability and user experience by allowing users to filter digital resources alphabetically.

## How It Works

Users can select any letter from the alphabet displayed at the top of the Digital Resources page. With a recent update, the glossary feature has been refined to filter and display entries based on the first letter of their first word. This focused approach aims to streamline search results and make the filtering process more intuitive.

## Display Location

The glossary feature is prominently displayed on the [Library's Digital Resources page](https://library.austintexas.gov/digital/all), making it accessible to all visitors interested in exploring the Library's digital resources.
