# Digital Resource Glossary Feature Documentation

## Overview

The Digital Resource Glossary feature is an interactive tool available on the [Library's Digital Resources page](https://library.austintexas.gov/digital/all). It allows users to filter digital resources alphabetically, enhancing navigability and user experience.

## How It Works

Users can select any letter from the alphabet displayed at the top of the Digital Resources page. The glossary feature then filters and displays only those entries that contain words starting with the selected letter. This includes titles where the selected letter may not be the first character but is the starting letter of subsequent words in the title.

## Recent Update

As part of our commitment to continuous improvement and in response to user feedback, we've recently updated the glossary feature. Now, when a user selects a letter, the corresponding letter in each word of the titles displayed is underlined. This visual cue was implemented to make it clearer why certain entries are included for each letter filter, addressing previous confusion and enhancing the overall usability of the feature.

## Display Location

The glossary feature is prominently displayed on the [Library's Digital Resources page](https://library.austintexas.gov/digital/all), available to all visitors seeking to explore our digital offerings.
